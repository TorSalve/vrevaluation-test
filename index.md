# How to Evaluate Object Selection and Manipulation in VR? Guidelines from 20 Years of Studies

## How to contribute
We would love you to give feedback and contribute to these guidelines. As many things, they are not fixed in stone, but rather a living thing that need to evolve with time. You can contribute both to the guidelines and checklist, but before you do, take a look at our [Code of Conduct][coc].

Both guideline and checklist have a connected Google Docs document, that is open for revision and comments. Find links to those documents on the relevant subpages.
